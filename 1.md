# Given a scenario, install and configure laptop hardware and components

## Battery

- Lithium ion and lithium ion polymer are common
- no `memory effect`
- charging the battery diminishes capacity.
- battery types and styles can vary acc to the laptop model, so while purchasing the battery buy the battery specificaly for that device.

## Keyboard/keys

- can be easy to replace.
- a few screws and a single ribbon cable.
- may not always be this simple or easy.
- is there is an problem with a laptop keyboard the easy fix is using the external keyboard.
- keys are very delicate so change them with proper care and dont intact the mechanisms of the keys.

## RAM

- small outline dual in-line memory module(SO-DIMM) are a memory types used in laptop because its small in size.
- some laptop memory is soldered into the system board, no upgrade is available here so you have to replace full system board.

## Laptop storage

magnetic disk:

- traditional spinning drive platters.
- 2.5 form factors(3.5 inch for desktop)

SSD(solid state drive):

- all memory no moving part
- silent, fast access time, less latency.
- 2.5 inch form factor
- some are having a form factor of hdd and other are smaller like M.2

M.2:

- smaller form factor
- no SATA data or power cables.
- easy to install and replace
- to install a physical memory you can address the manual of that laptop or motherboard.

Migration from HDD to SSD:

- one way to do is: install an OS on the SSD, move user documents between drives, install any required applications, its a manual process so it takes time and not efficient.
- Image or Clone the HDD. for this we need the software that can create the `image of the hardrive` that can be copied to SSD
- the other method is to directly image from drive to drive. to this it requires that 2 system are working simultaneously or the system provide the dual memory spaces.

## Wireless cards

- wireless network provide connectivity without the wires.
- older networks may contain the mini pci and mini pci express
hello its a test
